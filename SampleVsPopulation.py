This is a program that allows you to compare a population dataset to several subgroups/samples of it, and tell whether the sample
is significantly different from the population based on a given feature.

The samples are made by dividing the population dataset into them based on the values of a given feature (sample feature).
For example, if you choose 'Gender' as your sample feature, the samples will be the 'Male' and 'Female' samples.

Comparison is done by calculating the Z-Score and Standard Error of Sample Proportion (SEp) of each sample to the population.
NOTE: Only SEp is being used to determine whether the sample is significantly different from the population.
      Its Z-score is only being calculated but not used for comparison. Kept just in case.

To determine whether the sample is significantly different from the population,
you calculate the upper bound (UB) and lower bound (LB) of it based on its proportion (frequency/total number) using the ff:

UB = p + SEp * Z
LB = p - SEp * Z

Where Z is the Z Critical Value inputted by the user based on ά he/she desires.
For example, if the user wants ά = 1% interval, then Z Critical Value is 2.58
