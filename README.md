# OOTO-Miner-Python
This is the full Python implementation of the OOTO Miner based off of its Java implementation (see OOTO-Miner-Java). It is much lighter and faster.

The Out of the Ordinary (OOTO) Miner is a data mining application that analyses two groups of data - taken from a single data set - and mines out the features that make them different (or rather, out of the ordinary) from each other. The tests used to compare the two group sof data are chi-test and z-test.
